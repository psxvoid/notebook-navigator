## Commands

Set custom hotkeys for these commands in Obsidian's Hotkeys settings:

**View & navigation**

- `Notebook Navigator: Open` Opens Notebook Navigator in left sidebar. If already open, focuses the file list pane. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+E` to move keyboard focus to the list pane - **this is essential for full keyboard navigation**
- `Notebook Navigator: Open homepage` Opens the Notebook Navigator view and loads the homepage file configured in settings
- `Notebook Navigator: Reveal file` Reveals current file in navigator. Expands parent folders and scrolls to file. This command is useful if you have the setting `Auto-reveal active note` switched off and want to reveal notes manually
- `Notebook Navigator: Navigate to folder` Search dialog to jump to any folder
- `Notebook Navigator: Navigate to tag` Search dialog to jump to any tag
- `Notebook Navigator: Add to shortcuts` Adds the current file, folder, or tag to shortcuts
- `Notebook Navigator: Search` Opens quick search field or focuses it if already open. Search persists between sessions. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F` for quick file filtering

**Layout & display**

- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle dual pane layout` Toggle single/dual-pane layout (desktop)
- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle descendants` Toggle descendants notes display for both folders and tags. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+S` to quickly toggle display of notes from descendants
- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle hidden items` Show or hide excluded folders and hidden tags
- `Notebook Navigator: Toggle tag sort` Toggle between alphabetical and frequency-based tag sorting
- `Notebook Navigator: Collapse / expand all items` Collapse or expand all items based on the current state. When `Keep selected item expanded` is enabled (default on), all folders except the current one will be collapsed. This is super handy to keep the navigation tree tidy when searching for documents. **Suggestion:** Bind to a shortcut key like `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+C` to quickly collapse non-selected items

**File operations**

**Note:** When creating new notes in Obsidian you can choose the `Default location for new notes` in Obsidian settings. This can be the the root folder, same folder as current file, or a specific folder. When working with Notebook Navigator, especially with the setting `Show notes from descendants` enabled, none of these options are preferred. Instead you always want to create new notes in the currently selected folder (for example if you have `Show notes from descendants` on, and have a note in a descendant folder selected, you do not want the new note to appear in the descendant folder). The same also applies to moving and deleting files. This is why you should use these commands instead of the built-in Obsidian commands when using Notebook Navigator.

- `Notebook Navigator: Create new note` Create note in currently selected folder. **Suggestion:** Bind `Cmd/Ctrl+N` to this command (unbind from Obsidian's default "Create new note" first)
- `Notebook Navigator: Move files` Move selected files to another folder. Selects next file in current folder
- `Notebook Navigator: Convert to folder note` Create a folder matching the file name and move the file inside as the folder note
- `Notebook Navigator: Pin all folder notes` Add all folder notes to shortcuts. Only available when folder notes are enabled
- `Notebook Navigator: Delete files` Delete selected files. Selects next file in current folder

**Tag operations**

- `Notebook Navigator: Add tag to selected files` Dialog to add tag to selected files. Supports creating new tags
- `Notebook Navigator: Remove tag from selected files` Dialog to remove specific tag. Removes immediately if only one tag
- `Notebook Navigator: Remove all tags from selected files` Clear all tags from selected files with confirmation

**Maintenance**

- `Notebook Navigator: Rebuild cache` Rebuilds the local Notebook Navigator cache. Use this if you experience missing tags, incorrect previews or missing feature images

  - **Force square feature image:** Render feature images as square thumbnails
  - **Use embedded image fallback:** Use the first embedded image in the document as a fallback when no thumbnail is found in frontmatter properties (requires Obsidian 1.9.4+). Disable this to verify that thumbnails are properly configured

**Note:** When date, preview, and feature image are disabled, list pane displays in compact "slim mode" with only note names.

### Icon packs

Optional icon packs to expand available icons beyond the default Lucide icons:

- **Bootstrap Icons:** Over 2,000 icons - [icons.getbootstrap.com](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/)
- **Font Awesome (Solid):** Classic icon set - [fontawesome.com](https://fontawesome.com/)
- **Material Icons:** Google's Material Design icons - [fonts.google.com/icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons)
- **Phosphor:** Flexible icon family - [phosphoricons.com](https://phosphoricons.com/)
- **RPG Awesome:** Fantasy and RPG-themed icons - [nagoshiashumari.github.io/Rpg-Awesome](https://nagoshiashumari.github.io/Rpg-Awesome/)
- **Simple Icons:** 3,364 brand icons - [simpleicons.org](https://simpleicons.org/)

**How it works:** Icon packs are downloaded on-demand when you enable them in settings. Downloads occur from GitHub (`github.com/johansan/notebook-navigator`) and are cached locally for offline use. No automatic downloads or updates occur - you have full control over when icon packs are installed or removed.

**Note:** Downloaded icon packs sync installation state across devices. Icons stay in the local database on each device; sync only tracks whether to download or remove them.

### Search & Hotkeys

- **Search provider:** Choose between quick file name search or full-text search with Omnisearch plugin
  - **Filter search (default):** Fast, lightweight search that filters files by name and tags within the current folder and subfolders. Supports tag filtering with # prefix (e.g., #project), exclusion with ! prefix (e.g., !draft, !#archived), and finding untagged notes with !#
  - **Omnisearch:** Full-text search that searches your entire vault, then filters the results to show only files from the current folder, subfolders, or selected tags. Requires the [Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) plugin to be installed - falls back to Filter search if not available
    - **Known limitations:**
      - Performance can be slow, especially when searching for less than 3 characters in large vaults
      - Cannot search in paths with non-ASCII characters and does not search subpaths correctly
      - Since Omnisearch searches the entire vault and returns a limited number of results before filtering, relevant files from your current folder may not appear if too many matches exist elsewhere
      - Note previews are replaced with Omnisearch result excerpts, which may not show the actual search match highlight

- **Keyboard shortcuts:** Edit `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/notebook-navigator/data.json` to customize shortcuts. Locate the `keyboardShortcuts` section and define entries in this format:

```json
"pane:move-up": [
  { "key": "ArrowUp", "modifiers": [] },
  { "key": "K", "modifiers": [] }
]
```

- Standard modifiers:
  - `"Mod" = Cmd (macOS) / Ctrl (Win/Linux)`
  - `"Alt" = Alt/Option`
  - `"Shift" = Shift`
  - `"Ctrl" = Control (prefer "Mod" for cross-platform)`

- Add multiple mappings to support alternate keys, as shown above. Combine modifiers in one entry by listing each value, for example `"modifiers": ["Mod", "Shift"]`. Keyboard sequences (for example `"gg"` or `"dd"`) are not supported. Reload Obsidian after editing the file.

### Advanced

- **Check for new version on start:** Check for new plugin releases on startup and show a notification when an update is available. Each version is announced only once, and checks occur at most once per day
- **Confirm before deleting:** Show confirmation dialog when deleting notes or folders
- **Clean up metadata:** Removes orphaned metadata left behind when files, folders, or tags are deleted, moved, or renamed outside of Obsidian. This includes file icons, file colors, folder customizations, tag customizations, and pinned notes
- **Rebuild cache:** Use this if you experience missing tags, incorrect previews or missing feature images. This can happen after sync conflicts or unexpected closures

**Note:** The database size indicator is displayed at the bottom of the Advanced settings tab, showing the total size of the local cache database used for storing metadata, previews, and feature images.
